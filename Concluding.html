           </br>
           <p>For many years, anthropologists have been screaming that race is not biological and that we are all one race. 
             Biologically, this is true. However, arguing that we are one race does a disservice in attempting to create a trajectory 
             for racial equality. Claiming that we are one race essentially ignores the painful history and implications of the 
             establishment of social races and discredits sentiments of those still suffering in our current sociopolitical climate. 
           </p>
           </br>
          <p>It is important that we recognize our past and celebrate diversity rather than drawing arbitrary lines between people 
            based on the way they look.
